# Weather-MVP

I use MVP architecture in this demo. it is very common design pattern

you can find Model/DataPorvider/Views

View : The view now consists of both views and view controllers, with all UI setup and events.

DataPorvider : It will be in charge of all the logic , including network / transform the data to model whice match to the view for update

Model : a constant struct always be a datasource for the views
